Here's what I want React to do:

1. When I press a button, something happens:
	a. an ajax thing gets sent that asks for data from the server. This data is displayed in React components that are created.
	b. The global state of the interface changes and everything moves to where it should be.

That's about it actually. It would also be nice if components could react in different ways depending on the state, e.g. different colours on hover.
